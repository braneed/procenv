# TODO

- networking details
- add statfs(2)
- add to show_sizeof():
  - intN_t group   
- i18n (gettext)
- don't hide any option that a particular O/S / arch doesn't
  have: show the option with a value of `UNKNOWN_STR'.
- allow data to be dumped in JSON and XML by implementing a keyvalue()
  macro that replaces the existing calls to show() when used in the
  context of dumping a key/value pair along with logic to change the
  output format.
- uptime (using utmp)?
- text/data/bss/stack details (end(3), sbrk(2))
- mincore(2)?
- add program arguments to show_misc().
- add process arguments to show_proc_branch()?
- sort output of show_mounts().
- use CPUID instruction to detect XEN environments?
- use dlopen to probe for apparmor/selinux. This avoids having to depend
  on the existence of the appropriate libs, but still allows security
  context information to be queried on systems that provide them.
- add in permissions for /dev/tty and fds 0-2 if they refer to devices.
- ELF details.
